Added a method to the Room class: addGuest which just adds a user to the guest list
Added a method to the ServerData class: addUsertoRoom which searches through the room list
	checks each room for the join code, if it find the room then it will add the user 
	to the guest list of the room, else it will print an error message. Uses a added 
	boolean variable to check at the end.
Added a method to ServerMsgDecoder: getArg1 which returns the the first index of the 
	messageAsArray, just make sure usage is clear that the second word in the 
	string is the room code.

                                                                        String roomCode = messageDecoder.getArg1();
                                                                        ServerData.addUsertoRoom(user, roomcode);
                                                                }
